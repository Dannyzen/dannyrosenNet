#Funny story...
So, namecheap was my hosting provider for a few years. Recently, I decided to switch to another provider. Figured I had a copy of my source. I didn't. So I did what anyone would do, I asked them nicely if I could get a tar of the source from the site. 

"That'll cost you $20" they said.

Not cool namecheap, not cool.
